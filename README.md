# Simple_Classless_REST

The project uses two techniques: **Rewrite engine** and **Representational State Transfer**. 
Although it is not mandatory, these are often used collectively.

A description of the general principles of *Rewrite engine* and *Representational State Transfer*
can be found in project [Simple_OOP_REST](https://github.com/mentalmove/Simple_OOP_REST)


### Object Orientation or not Object Orientation
Rewriting and REST can be used as well object oriented as functional.  
**This shall not be a discussion about the advantages and disadvantages of OOP.
Providing a classless version is just a proof of concept.**  
For a project like this, one would probably
prefer Object Oriented Programming (see link above) for readability reasons
while for a pure technical API it could be worth thinking about a classless solution.

Prerequsites and result should be identical.
